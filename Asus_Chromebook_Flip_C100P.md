## Mainline Kernel Issues

* When running the Mainline Kernel, you may be able to only use 2 GB of RAM, even on a 4 GB Ram unit. There is a fix described [in a thread on the forums](https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=11705&hilit=c100p&start=20), but as of November 15th, 2017, the problem isn't fixed upstream with Linux 4.14.1 yet.
